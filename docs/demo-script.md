The smooth auto-scroll engine runs at 60fps using requestAnimationFrame. You can adjust the speed on the fly from 0.5x to 10x.

No more awkward pauses or rushed delivery.

This is a game-changer. Open the web interface on any device connected to your network, and you have full control:

- Play and pause
- Adjust speed
- Jump to sections
- See your progress

Your phone becomes your teleprompter remote.

### Stream Deck Integration

| Category | Actions |
|----------|---------|
| Playback | Play, Pause, Toggle, Reset |
| Speed | Up, Down, Presets, Min, Max |
| Navigation | Next Section, Previous, Jump |
| Display | Fullscreen, Pin, Keep Awake |

Hardware control at your fingertips.

## Best Practices

### Preparing Your Script

> **Pro Tip:** Use headers to structure your content. The navigation panel makes it easy to jump between sections during Q&A.

Write in a conversational tone. Short sentences work best. Give yourself room to breathe.

### Setting Up Your Space

1. Position your screen at eye level
2. Use the eyeline indicator as your focus point
3. Start with speed 2x and adjust as needed
4. Enable countdown timer for smooth starts

### During Recording

Keep these shortcuts handy:

- **Space** - Toggle play/pause
- **↑/↓** - Adjust speed
- **Cmd+F** - Fullscreen mode

## Advanced Features

### Voice Tracking (Beta)

Our experimental voice tracking feature follows your speech and scrolls automatically. It uses Vosk for local speech recognition - no cloud services, complete privacy.

### OBS Integration

Connect to OBS Studio to sync your recordings:

```
WebSocket: ws://localhost:4455
```

Start recording when you start scrolling. Stop when you're done.

### Flip Modes

For traditional teleprompter rigs with beam splitters:

- **Horizontal Flip** - Mirror text left-to-right
- **Vertical Flip** - Flip text upside down
- **Both** - Full 180° rotation
